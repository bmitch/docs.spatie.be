title: Customizing the uptime check
---

This package ships with a default configured uptime check. You can modify the behaviour of the uptime check by changing the values under the `uptime_check` key in the config file.

These are the default values:

```php
    'uptime_check' => [

        /*
         * An uptime check will be performed if the last check was performed more than the
         * given number of minutes ago. If you change this setting you have to manually
         * update the `uptime_check_interval_in_minutes` value of your existing sites.
         *
         * When a site is down we'll check the uptime every time `sites:check-uptime` runs
         * regardless of this setting.
         */
        'run_interval_in_minutes' => 5,

        /*
         * To speed up the uptime checking process uptime monitor can check multiple sites
         * concurrently. Set this to a lower value if you're getting weird errors
         * running the uptime check.
         */
        'concurrent_checks' => 10,

        /*
         * The uptime check for a site will fail if the site does not respond after the
         * given number of seconds.
         */
        'timeout_per_site' => 10,

        /*
         * Fire `Spatie\UptimeMonitor\Events\MonitorFailed` event only after
         * the given amount of checks have consecutively failed for a site.
         */
        'fire_monitor_failed_event_after_consecutive_failures' => 2,

        /*
         * When requesting sites, this user agent will be used.
         */
        'user_agent' => 'spatie/laravel-uptime-monitor uptime checker',
```
